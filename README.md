# EthicalLabor
The global manufacturing industry, particularly in developing countries like India, faces significant challenges in ensuring ethical labor practices. We are addressing these challenges through a blockchain-based ethical labor verification  system, coupled with a cryptocurrency incentive model.

Our current demo version is a simplified representation of the full system, designed to 
showcase the core concepts and functionality. It consists of three main smart contracts: 
LaborCompliance.sol, WorkerRegistry.sol, and EthiCoin.sol. Here's a detailed breakdown 
of the demo design and its limitations:
A. Demo Design:
1. LaborCompliance.sol:
 - Core contract for logging work hours and ensuring compliance.
 - Features:
 - Sets and stores compliance rules (minimum wage, max working hours).
 - Logs work hours and wages for each worker.
 - Checks compliance and issues rewards or penalties in EthiCoin.
 - Stores work records with compliance status.
2. WorkerRegistry.sol:
 - Manages worker registration and employer authorization.
 - Features:
 - Registers workers with basic details (name, position, qualifications, start/end dates).
 - Authorizes employers to interact with the system.
 - Provides worker detail retrieval function.
3. EthiCoin.sol:
 - Implements the EthiCoin token for rewards and penalties.
 - Features:
 - ERC20 compliant token.
 - Minting of initial supply.
 - Reward and burn functions for compliance incentives.
B. Key Functionalities Demonstrated:
1. Worker Registration: Ability to add workers to the system.
2. Compliance Rule Setting: Demonstration of how labor standards are set.
3. Work Hour Logging: Manual logging of work hours and wages.
4. Compliance Checking: Automatic verification against set standards.
5. Reward/Penalty System: Issuance or burning of EthiCoin based on compliance.
6. Data Retrieval: Ability to fetch worker details and work records.
C. Limitations of the Current Demo:
1. Simplified Data Model:
 - Limited worker and work record details compared to a full system.
 - Lacks comprehensive attributes for complex labor scenarios.
2. Manual Data Entry:
 - Work hours and wages are manually entered, not automatically captured.
 - Prone to human error and potential manipulation.
3. Basic Compliance Rules:
 - Only considers minimum wage and maximum hours.
 - Lacks nuanced rules for overtime, breaks, or specific industry standards.
4. Limited IoT Integration:
 - No actual integration with IoT devices for environmental monitoring.
 - Safety compliance is not demonstrated in the current version.
5. Centralized Authority:
 - Employer authorization is simplistic and centralized.
 - Lacks a sophisticated governance model for system management.
6. Basic Token Economics:
 - EthiCoin implementation is basic, lacking advanced tokenomics features.
 - No integration with external exchanges or complex reward mechanisms.
7. Absence of User Interface:
 - Current version is backend-only, without a user-friendly interface.
 - Interaction requires direct contract calls, not suitable for non-technical users.
This demo version serves as a proof of concept, demonstrating the core ideas of using 
blockchain for labor compliance and token-based incentives. It provides a foundation for 
understanding how the system would work at a basic level. However, for real-world
implementation, significant enhancements would be needed in terms of functionality, 
security, privacy, scalability, and user experience.
The limitations highlighted here would be addressed in subsequent development phases, 
transforming this basic demo into a robust, secure, and comprehensive ethical labor 
verification system ready for real-world deployment.
